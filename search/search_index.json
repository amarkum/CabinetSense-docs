AC1009 (AutoCAD R12): Widely compatible with most CNC software including older machines. AC1021 (AutoCAD 2007): Supports newer features but may not work with all CNC controllers. If unsure, use AC1009 for maximum compatibility. Z-axis zero: Top of Part: Z-zero is at the top surface of the material. Drill depths go downward (negative Z). This is the most common setting. Bottom of Part: Z-zero is at the bottom surface. Drill depths go upward (positive Z). Used with some CNC setups where the spoilboard is the reference. Granularity: Controls the resolution of curves in the DXF output. Higher granularity produces smoother curves but larger files. Lower granularity produces smaller files with slightly faceted curves. Default settings work well for most CNC machines. Optimization: Multiple optimization methods are available for tool path efficiency. Optimization reduces unnecessary tool movements and can speed up machining. Multi-pass: For deep cuts (dadoes, rabbets), multi-pass splits the operation into multiple shallow passes. Configure the maximum cut depth per pass based on your tooling and material. Flip operation direction: Controls how double-sided parts are handled. When a part has machining on both sides, CabinetSense generates two DXF files (Side 1 and Side 2). The flip direction determines whether the part is flipped left-to-right or top-to-bottom when machining the second side. Layout orientation: Sets whether parts are laid out in landscape or portrait orientation on the CNC bed. 3D DXF: Enables full 3D DXF output with Z-axis depth information. Some CNC software requires 3D DXF for proper tool depth processing. Vectric compatibility: CabinetSense DXF files are compatible with Vectric VCarve and Aspire.
